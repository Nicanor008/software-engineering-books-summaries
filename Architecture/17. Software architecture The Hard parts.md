# Software architecture The Hard parts
Author: Neal Ford, Mark Richards, et al


## Overview
"Software Architecture: The Hard Parts" focuses on the most challenging and critical decisions that software architects face when designing and implementing complex systems. The authors draw from their extensive experience to discuss architectural patterns, principles, trade-offs, and decision-making strategies that help in building robust, scalable, and maintainable software systems.

The book is structured to address various "hard parts" of software architecture, including distributed architectures, microservices, data management, integration, evolutionary architecture, and organizational dynamics.
