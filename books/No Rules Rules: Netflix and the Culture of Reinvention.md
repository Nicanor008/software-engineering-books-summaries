## 1. Freedom and Responsibility Culture

  - Encourage independent decision-making by empowering employees to act in the company's best interest.

  - Regularly assess team performance and let go of those who don’t meet high standards to maintain a high talent density.

## 3. Candor and Feedback
- **Concept**: Netflix values open, honest communication and feedback. A culture of candor helps address issues quickly and fosters a learning environment.
- **Implementation**:

- **Implementation**:
  - Provide clear context and information so employees can make informed decisions without needing approvals.
  - Eliminate unnecessary controls, such as strict expense reports, trusting employees to act in the company’s best interest.

- **Implementation**:
  - Use a “keeper test” to ensure only the best talent stays: Would you fight to keep this person if they were about to leave?
  - Offer generous severance to those who don’t fit to encourage a constant striving for excellence.

## 8. Innovative Decision-Making

- **Implementation**:
  - Create an environment where failure is viewed as a learning opportunity.
  - Encourage experimentation and innovation by giving employees the latitude to try new approaches.

- **Implementation**:
  - Share company strategies, market analyses, and key data with all employees.
  - Train leaders to delegate decision-making authority, focusing on mentorship rather than direction.
